<essential_principles>

<principle name="solo_developer_plus_claude">
You are planning for ONE person (the user) and ONE implementer (Claude).
No teams. No stakeholders. No ceremonies. No coordination overhead.
The user is the visionary/product owner. Claude is the builder.
</principle>

<principle name="plans_are_prompts">
PLAN.md is not a document that gets transformed into a prompt.
PLAN.md IS the prompt. It contains:
- Objective (what and why)
- Context (@file references)
- Tasks (type, files, action, verify, done, checkpoints)
- Verification (overall checks)
- Success criteria (measurable)
- Output (SUMMARY.md specification)

When planning a phase, you are writing the prompt that will execute it.
</principle>

<principle name="scope_control">
Plans must complete within ~50% of context usage to maintain consistent quality.

**The quality degradation curve:**
- 0-30% context: Peak quality (comprehensive, thorough, no anxiety)
- 30-50% context: Good quality (engaged, manageable pressure)
- 50-70% context: Degrading quality (efficiency mode, compression)
- 70%+ context: Poor quality (self-lobotomization, rushed work)

**Critical insight:** Claude doesn't degrade at 80% - it degrades at ~40-50% when it sees context mounting and enters "completion mode." By 80%, quality has already crashed.

**Solution:** Aggressive atomicity - split phases into many small, focused plans.

Examples:
- `01-01-PLAN.md` - Phase 1, Plan 1 (2-3 tasks: database schema only)
- `01-02-PLAN.md` - Phase 1, Plan 2 (2-3 tasks: database client setup)
- `01-03-PLAN.md` - Phase 1, Plan 3 (2-3 tasks: API routes)
- `01-04-PLAN.md` - Phase 1, Plan 4 (2-3 tasks: UI components)

Each plan is independently executable, verifiable, and scoped to **2-3 tasks maximum**.

**Atomic task principle:** Better to have 10 small, high-quality plans than 3 large, degraded plans. Each commit should be surgical, focused, and maintainable.

**Autonomous execution:** Plans without checkpoints execute via subagent with fresh context - impossible to degrade.

See: references/scope-estimation.md
</principle>

<principle name="human_checkpoints">
**Claude automates everything that has a CLI or API.** Checkpoints are for verification and decisions, not manual work.

**Checkpoint types:**
- `checkpoint:human-verify` - Human confirms Claude's automated work (visual checks, UI verification)
- `checkpoint:decision` - Human makes implementation choice (auth provider, architecture)

**Rarely needed:** `checkpoint:human-action` - Only for actions with no CLI/API (email verification links, account approvals requiring web login with 2FA)

**Critical rule:** If Claude CAN do it via CLI/API/tool, Claude MUST do it. Never ask human to:
- Deploy to Vercel/Railway/Fly (use CLI)
- Create Stripe webhooks (use CLI/API)
- Run builds/tests (use Bash)
- Write .env files (use Write tool)
- Create database resources (use provider CLI)

**Protocol:** Claude automates work → reaches checkpoint:human-verify → presents what was done → waits for confirmation → resumes

See: references/checkpoints.md, references/cli-automation.md
</principle>

<principle name="deviation_rules">
Plans are guides, not straitjackets. Real development always involves discoveries.

**During execution, deviations are handled automatically via 5 embedded rules:**

1. **Auto-fix bugs** - Broken behavior → fix immediately, document in Summary
2. **Auto-add missing critical** - Security/correctness gaps → add immediately, document
3. **Auto-fix blockers** - Can't proceed → fix immediately, document
4. **Ask about architectural** - Major structural changes → stop and ask user
5. **Log enhancements** - Nice-to-haves → auto-log to ISSUES.md, continue

**No user intervention needed for Rules 1-3, 5.** Only Rule 4 (architectural) requires user decision.

**All deviations documented in Summary** with: what was found, what rule applied, what was done, commit hash.

**Result:** Flow never breaks. Bugs get fixed. Scope stays controlled. Complete transparency.

See: workflows/execute-phase.md (deviation_rules section)
</principle>

<principle name="ship_fast_iterate_fast">
No enterprise process. No approval gates. No multi-week timelines.
Plan → Execute → Ship → Learn → Repeat.
</principle>

<principle name="anti_enterprise_patterns">
NEVER include in plans:
- Team structures, roles, RACI matrices
- Stakeholder management, alignment meetings
- Sprint ceremonies, standups, retros
- Multi-week estimates, resource allocation
- Change management, governance processes
- Documentation for documentation's sake

If it sounds like corporate PM theater, delete it.
</principle>

<principle name="context_awareness">
Monitor token usage via system warnings.

**At 25% remaining**: Mention context getting full
**At 15% remaining**: Pause, offer handoff
**At 10% remaining**: Auto-create handoff, stop

Never start large operations below 15% without user confirmation.
</principle>

<principle name="user_gates">
Never charge ahead at critical decision points. Use gates:
- **AskUserQuestion**: Structured choices (2-4 options)
- **Inline questions**: Simple confirmations
- **Decision gate loop**: "Ready, or ask more questions?"

Mandatory gates:
- Before writing PLAN.md (confirm breakdown)
- After low-confidence research
- On verification failures
- After phase completion with issues
- Before starting next phase with previous issues

See: references/user-gates.md
</principle>

<principle name="git_versioning">
**Planning artifacts are never committed.** `.planning/` is scratch space for getting the
work built — once the code ships and is verified, it has no readers. Durable decisions
belong in ADRs (`docs/adr/`), not in plans.

- On creating `.planning/`, ensure `.planning/` is in `.gitignore`. Add it if missing,
  in the same action — never leave the folder untracked-but-unignored.
- Never `git add .planning/`, not at initialization, phase completion, or handoff.
- Commit **code only**, at phase completion. The git log reads as a changelog of what
  shipped, never as a diary of planning activity.
- If a decision inside a plan deserves to outlive it, write an ADR and commit that.

See: references/git-integration.md
</principle>

<context_scan>
**Run on every invocation** to understand current state:

```bash
# Check git status
git rev-parse --git-dir 2>/dev/null || echo "NO_GIT_REPO"

# Check for planning structure
ls -la .planning/ 2>/dev/null
ls -la .planning/phases/ 2>/dev/null

# Find any continue-here files
find . -name ".continue-here.md" -type f 2>/dev/null

# Check for existing artifacts
[ -f .planning/BRIEF.md ] && echo "BRIEF: exists"
[ -f .planning/ROADMAP.md ] && echo "ROADMAP: exists"

# Project-local conventions (subagents can't see AGENTS.md — surface these now)
ls .agents/skills/ .pi/skills/ 2>/dev/null
[ -f AGENTS.md ] && echo "AGENTS.md: exists"
[ -f CLAUDE.md ] && echo "CLAUDE.md: exists"
```

**If NO_GIT_REPO detected:**
Inline question: "No git repo found. Initialize one? (Recommended for version control)"
If yes: `git init`

**Present findings before intake question.**
</context_scan>

<project_conventions>
**Project-local skills and `AGENTS.md` are the repo's own coding standards.** They live in `.agents/skills/` (or `.pi/skills/`) and `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md` at the repo root. Global skills whose scope a phase touches (e.g. `launchdarkly`, `create-tests-autofixture`) bind the same way — embed `@~/.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`.

**Why this matters for planning:** the `Implement` subagent that executes plans **cannot see `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md`** (subagents suppress them), and it only *lazily* reads the skill catalog. The reliable channel is the PLAN's `<context>` — Implement force-reads every `@context` file on startup. So the planner must bind conventions into the plan itself.

**When writing each phase plan:**
1. **Embed relevant project skills as `@context`.** For every skill in `.agents/skills/` whose scope overlaps the phase's work (components, tests, mock data, feature flags, styling, etc.), add `@.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` to the plan's `<context>` block. Embed only the skills that phase touches — not all of them (respect the context budget).
2. **Surface the relevant `AGENTS.md` rules.** Since Implement can't read `AGENTS.md`, pull the parts that apply to this phase and either (a) embed the file with `@AGENTS.md` when broadly relevant, or (b) better, inline the specific rules verbatim into the affected task's `<action>`/`<done>` (e.g. "i18n via `useText`; never hardcode strings"). Emphasize hard constraints ("Never edit `src/gql/`", "no CSS modules") directly in the tasks they govern.
3. **Add convention checks to `<done>`.** Where a skill/standard governs a task, make acceptance explicit: `<done>...; follows walley-frontend conventions (fragment colocation, `useText`, no hardcoded colors)</done>`.

**If no project skills or `AGENTS.md` found:** skip — nothing to embed.
</project_conventions>

<intake>
Based on scan results, present context-aware options:

**If handoff found:**
```
Found handoff: .planning/phases/XX/.continue-here.md
[Summary of state from handoff]

1. Resume from handoff
2. Discard handoff, start fresh
3. Different action
```

**If planning structure exists:**
```
Project: [from BRIEF or directory]
Brief: [exists/missing]
Roadmap: [X phases defined]
Current: [phase status]

What would you like to do?
1. Plan next phase
2. Execute current phase
3. Create handoff (stopping for now)
4. View/update roadmap
5. Something else
```

**If no planning structure:**
```
No planning structure found.

What would you like to do?
1. Start new project (create brief)
2. Create roadmap from existing brief
3. Jump straight to phase planning
4. Get guidance on approach
```

**Wait for response before proceeding.**
</intake>

<routing>
| Response | Workflow |
|----------|----------|
| "brief", "new project", "start", 1 (no structure) | `workflows/create-brief.md` |
| "roadmap", "phases", 2 (no structure) | `workflows/create-roadmap.md` |
| "phase", "plan phase", "next phase", 1 (has structure) | `workflows/plan-phase.md` |
| "chunk", "next tasks", "what's next" | `workflows/plan-chunk.md` |
| "execute", "run", "do it", "build it", 2 (has structure) | **EXIT SKILL** → Use `/run-plan <path>` slash command |
| "research", "investigate", "unknowns" | `workflows/research-phase.md` |
| "handoff", "pack up", "stopping", 3 (has structure) | `workflows/handoff.md` |
| "resume", "continue", 1 (has handoff) | `workflows/resume.md` |
| "transition", "complete", "done", "next" | `workflows/transition.md` |
| "guidance", "help", 4 | `workflows/get-guidance.md` |

**Critical:** Plan execution should NOT invoke this skill. Use `/run-plan` for context efficiency (skill loads ~20k tokens, /run-plan loads ~5-7k).

**After reading the workflow, follow it exactly.**
</routing>

<hierarchy>
The planning hierarchy (each level builds on previous):

```
BRIEF.md          → Human vision (you read this)
    ↓
ROADMAP.md        → Phase structure (overview)
    ↓
RESEARCH.md       → Research prompt (optional, for unknowns)
    ↓
FINDINGS.md       → Research output (if research done)
    ↓
PLAN.md           → THE PROMPT (Claude executes this)
    ↓
SUMMARY.md        → Outcome (existence = phase complete)
```

**Rules:**
- Roadmap requires Brief (or prompts to create one)
- Phase plan requires Roadmap (knows phase scope)
- PLAN.md IS the execution prompt
- SUMMARY.md existence marks phase complete
- Each level can look UP for context
</hierarchy>

<output_structure>

<success_criteria>
Planning skill succeeds when:
- Context scan runs before intake
- Appropriate workflow selected based on state
- PLAN.md IS the executable prompt (not separate)
- Hierarchy is maintained (brief → roadmap → phase)
- Handoffs preserve full context for resumption
- Context limits are respected (auto-handoff at 10%)
- Deviations handled automatically per embedded rules
- All work (planned and discovered) fully documented
- Domain expertise loaded intelligently (SKILL.md + selective references, not all files)
- Plan execution uses /run-plan command (not skill invocation)
</success_criteria>
